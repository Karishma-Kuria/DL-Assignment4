# The repo contains the below implementation:
### a) Do a codelab with all hyperparameters learning rate decay, dropout, batch norm </br>
### b) Various experiments with weights and biases of hyperparameters in weights and biases of various optimizers, layer depth width, learning rate etc.,. using keras </br>
### c) Various experiments with weights and biases of hyperparameters in weights and biases of various optimizers, layer depth width, learning rate etc.,. using Pytorch </br>
### d) Keras  classifier for regression problem, image problem submit your colabs and artifacts links </br>
### e) Colab to Illustrate use of various activation functions, dropouts, learning rate schedulers, regularization techniques like gradient clipping, batch normalization, early stopping, l1 and l2 regularizations, optimizers on simple data set
